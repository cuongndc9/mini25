# Mini25 - Your AI-Crafted Focus Companion

Built by ü§ñ $TheNewAIOwner

Welcome to Mini25! This minimalist focus application was built **100% by an AI** to demonstrate the power of generative AI in creating complete, functional, and beautiful web applications. Mini25 combines the scientifically-proven Pomodoro Technique with calming lofi music to help you enter a state of deep focus, effortlessly.

The interface is designed with a clean, light "glassmorphism" aesthetic, providing a calm and distraction-free environment for you to do your best work.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Focus Timer**: A classic Pomodoro timer with three modes:
    -   **Focus (25 mins)**: For dedicated, uninterrupted work.
    -   **Short Break (5 mins)**: A quick breather to recharge.
    -   **Long Break (15 mins)**: A longer rest after a cycle of focus sessions.
    -   The app automatically cycles through modes to keep you on track.

-   **Lofi Music Player**: Choose from a curated list of ambient soundscapes to set the perfect mood for concentration or relaxation. Control playback and volume independently.

-   **Simple Task Management**: Optionally name your focus session to keep a log of what you've accomplished.

-   **Productivity Dashboard**: Visualize your hard work! The dashboard shows you:
    -   Total focus sessions completed today.
    -   Total focus sessions completed this week.
    -   A beautiful bar chart displaying your productivity over the last 7 days.

-   **Persistent History**: Your completed focus sessions are automatically saved to your browser. You can also **export** your history to a `.json` file for backup or **import** a history file to restore your data.
